      <hr>
      <h1><b>INFORMATION</b></h1>
      <p>IZ*ONE debuted in October 2018 with its first EP “COLORIZ” under Off The Record Entertainment and Swing Entertainment. It was a temporary project girl group formed with the 12 finalists of Mnet's audition show “Produce 48” (2018), the third season of the hit “Produce 101” franchise. The 12 winners had been announced in August 2018.<br>
        <br>
        The group consisted of members Jang Wonyoung, Miyawaki Sakura, Jo Yuri, Choi Yena, Ahn Yujin, Yabuki Nako, Kwon Eunbi, Kang Hyewon, Honda Hitomi, Kim Chaewon, Kim Minjoo, and Lee Chaeyeon.<br>
        <br>
        IZ*ONE was one of the most commercially successful girl groups of its time, breaking the record for highest CD sales in the first week of release on multiple occasions until it disbanded in April 2021.<br>
        <br>
        The girl group’s fandom is dubbed WIZ*ONE.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Which IZ*ONE members are Japanese?</b><br>
        <br>
        Members Sakura, Nako and Hitomi are Japanese. “Produce 48” brought together Korean contestants and Japanese hopefuls, the latter already being members of Japan’s “48” girl group franchise including AKB48, HKT48, NMB48, SKE48 and NGT48. Sakura and Nako were from HKT48, and Hitomi was from AKB48.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Where are IZ*ONE members now?</b><br>
        <br>
        After disbandment, each member went on to build their careers in the K-pop scene or other areas of entertainment. Nako and Hitomi went back to Japan to their original groups.<br>
        <br>
        Sakura also returned to her original group HKT48 in Japan but soon left, or “graduated.” She came back to Korea to sign with Source Music and re-debut as a member of girl group Le Sserafim in May 2022, along with former teammate Kim Chaewon.         
        Jang Wonyoung and Ahn Yujin re-debuted in December 2021 as members of girl group IVE.<br>
        <br>
        Jo Yuri, Choi Yena, Kwon Eunbi and Lee Chaeyeon are now solo singers. Chaeyeon also starred on Mnet’s hit dance competition program “Street Woman Fighter” (2021) prior to her solo debut.<br>
        <br>
        Kang Hyewon and Kim Minjoo are now actors. </p>

      <h1>IZ*ONE has wrapped up their final concert!</h1>
      <p>On March 13 and 14, IZ*ONE held their online concert “ONE, THE STORY.” This was their first concert in six months since their “ONEIRIC THEATER” concert in September. The concert featured the theme of seven different chapters in which IZ*ONE’s performances unfolded.<br>
        <br>
        Opening the stage with “La Vie en Rose” and “Mise-en-Scène,” the IZ*ONE members shared, “Although we can’t be in one location together due to unfortunate circumstances, we feel reassured and gain strength at the thought of WIZ*ONE [IZ*ONE’s official fan club name] from all over the world supporting us. We’ll work even harder while thinking that we’re together with WIZ*ONE from all over the world.”<br>
        <br>
        IZ*ONE proceeded to perform their hit title tracks and b-sides such as “BEAUTIFUL COLOR,” “O’ My!,” “Sunflower (Hey. Bae. Like it.),” “Highlight,” “Violeta,” “FIESTA,” “Rococo,” “Merry-Go-Round,” “Secret Story of the Swan,” “Panorama,” and “Sequence.” They also rearranged songs such as “OPEN YOUR EYES,” “Up,” “Airplane,” “Island,” “Pretty,” and “O Sole Mio” with beautiful acoustic melodies.<br>
        <br>
        The members captivated audiences with their diverse cover stages. Kwon Eun Bi and Honda Hitomi performed Camila Cabello’s “Senorita” and Tinashe’s “All Hands On Deck,” Miyawaki Sakura, Kim Min Ju, and Lee Chae Yeon performed Sunmi‘s “Full Moon,” Kim Chae Won, An Yu Jin, and Jo Yu Ri performed Tinashe’s “Adrenaline,” and Choi Ye Na, Kang Hye Won, Yabuki Nako, and Jang Won Young performed Boney M’s “Sunny” and T-ara’s “Roly Poly.”<br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, IZ*ONE also showcased their unit songs. Choi Ye Na, Jo Yu Ri, Kim Chae Won performed “Someday,” Kwon Eun Bi, Lee Chae Yeon, Kim Min Ju, and An Yu Jin performed “DAYDREAM,” and Miyawaki Sakura, Kang Hye Won, Yabuki Nako, Honda Hitomi, and Jang Won Young performed “PINK BLUSHER.”<br>
        <br>
        IZ*ONE also revealed a first look at their unreleased songs “Lesson” and “Parallel Universe.” “Lesson” is a song about continuing onwards while looking back on the days of running towards one’s dreams. Choi Ye Na participated in writing the lyrics for the song. Written and composed by Kwon Eun Bi, “Parallel Universe” is about how WIZ*ONE and IZ*ONE’s time together are permanent memories that exist somewhere like a parallel universe, and it contains the message that they’ll always look upon each other with the same feelings.<br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, the group showcased their growth as artists by performing songs that the members participated in creating such as “SPACESHIP,” “DREAMLIKE,” “Really Like You,” “With*One,” and “Slow Journey.”<br>
        <br>
        IZ*ONE also showcased surprise video letters towards each other. While expressing their gratitude towards fans who continued to love and support them during the two and a half years, the members couldn’t hold back their tears. They shared, “We were able to endure well and stand up again every time we were exhausted and struggling because the members and WIZ*ONE were there. Please always reliably be on our side, and thank you for making us unforgettable memories. We were happy each and every day thanks to WIZ*ONE.”<br>
        <br>
        IZ*ONE was formed as a project group through Mnet’s idol survival show “Produce 48.” The group debuted in October 2018 as a temporary group that would promote for two and a half years, and it was officially confirmed on March 10 that IZ*ONE will disband in April.</p>
